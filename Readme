This repository contains a collection of bots created for RuneScape, a popular online multiplayer game where players explore a fantasy world, 
complete quests, and engage in various skills like combat, crafting, and trading.
The bots in this repository automate specific in-game tasks, helping to improve efficiency in repetitive actions.

These scripts are crafted as a way to practice coding and reinforce core programming principles. Each bot is designed with clean, efficient code and reusable components,
with an emphasis on automation techniques, algorithms, and data structures.
The goal is not only to create functional bots but to refine coding skills and optimize solutions. Feedback and contributions are welcome!
